    <h3>About the Role</h3>
    <p>Timedrift is hiring a part-time Talent Scout to help identify promising solo game developers who are flying under the radar. This is a research-focused role centered on discovering great talent — not sales or outreach. The ideal candidate is deeply embedded in gaming culture, especially the indie scene, and has a strong instinct for originality and potential.</p>

    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Actively search for independent developers across platforms like Itch.io, Steam, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Discord.</li>
      <li>Evaluate and log 5–10 developers per day in a shared Google Sheet, including notes and relevant links.</li>
      <li>Flag 1–2 standout developers daily, with a short explanation of why they’re notable.</li>
      <li>Track game jam entries, devlogs, and social activity for promising leads.</li>
      <li>Join weekly check-ins to review findings and refine search criteria.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Qualifications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Deep familiarity with indie games and online game dev communities.</li>
      <li>Strong taste and instincts for originality in games and creators.</li>
      <li>Excellent attention to detail and clear written communication.</li>
      <li>Self-motivated, reliable, and comfortable working independently.</li>
      <li>No prior professional experience required — just curiosity and insight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preferred</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Participation in game jams or personal game dev projects.</li>
      <li>Involvement in Discord or other online gaming communities.</li>
      <li>Familiarity with engines like Unity, Godot, or Unreal.</li>
      <li>Experience using tools like SteamDB or Itch.io jam directories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Apply</h3>
    <p>No résumé required, but feel free to include it if you have one. We're most interested in how you think and what you notice. To apply, send a short email to the address below.</p>
    <p>Some suggestions on what to share:</p>
    <ul>
